Exercise 2: Writing Basic JUnit Tests

I created a simple Calculator class with basic arithmetic methods: add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
Then, I wrote JUnit test cases to validate each method using various assertions like assertEquals.
I also included a test to check exception handling for division by zero.
