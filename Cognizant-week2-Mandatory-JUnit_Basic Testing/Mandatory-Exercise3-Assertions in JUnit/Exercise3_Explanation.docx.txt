Exercise 3: Assertions in JUnit

In this exercise, I wrote unit tests using different JUnit assertions to validate expected outcomes.

Assertions used include:
- assertEquals to verify equality
- assertTrue and assertFalse to check conditions
- assertNull and assertNotNull to validate object references

These assertions ensure the correctness of logic in various test scenarios.
