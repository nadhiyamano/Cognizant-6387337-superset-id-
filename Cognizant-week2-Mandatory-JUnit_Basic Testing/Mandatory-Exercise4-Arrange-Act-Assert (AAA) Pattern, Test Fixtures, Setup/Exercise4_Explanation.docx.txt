Exercise 4: Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) Pattern, Test Fixtures, Setup and Teardown in JUnit

In this exercise, I implemented unit tests following the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern.

I used @Before to initialize test data before each test, and @After to clean up after each test.

Test cases include basic addition and subtraction using a Calculator class.

The tests verify correctness using assertions like assertEquals.

Code is provided in Calculator.java and CalculatorTest.java.
