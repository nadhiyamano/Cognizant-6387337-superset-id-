Exercise 1: Setting Up JUnit

To set up JUnit in my Java project, I created a Maven-based project and added the JUnit dependency in the pom.xml file. 
After setting up the project structure, I created a test class with a basic test case using JUnit.

This setup allows me to write and run unit tests effectively using JUnit.
